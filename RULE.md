# GoEngineKenga Mission Statement

## Supreme Goal: Surpass Unity & Unreal Engine

**GoEngineKenga will become the ultimate game engine, surpassing both Unity (for indie developers) and Unreal Engine (for AAA projects). Every developer will choose GoEngineKenga over commercial alternatives.**

### Why This Is Possible

**Unity & Unreal Engine Weaknesses:**
- Expensive licensing (Unity runtime fees, Unreal revenue share)
- Bloated codebases with technical debt
- Vendor lock-in and subscription models
- Limited customization without source access
- Performance overhead from generic architecture

**GoEngineKenga Advantages:**
- Zero licensing costs (MIT license)
- Clean, modern Go codebase
- Full source code access and customization
- Native performance with zero abstraction layers
- Perfect balance: indie-friendly like Unity, powerful like Unreal

### Development Principles

1. **Zero Compromises**: Every feature must be world-class
2. **Performance First**: Native Go performance with zero overhead
3. **Developer Experience**: Intuitive APIs, zero boilerplate
4. **Cross-Platform**: One codebase, every platform
5. **Open Source**: MIT license, full transparency
6. **Innovation**: Cutting-edge features before competitors
